This is a reference implementation of the Lens todo app defined in base directory. This implementation uses no
auxiliary patterns/libraries for state management and simply uses the basic app component state.  This implementation
also does not persist todo list changes.

I've tried to organize code for educational and maintainability purpose.  I've also tried to comment the code
to the extent I found useful.

There are no doubt bugs and/or better ways doing certain things (I am learning too).  Please submit issues/comments/feedback.

I'd greatly appreciate it.
