This is a reference implementation of the Lens todo app defined in base directory. This implementation uses the Redux
state management pattern so code is organized a bit differently the basic implementation.

I've tried to organize code for educational and maintainability purpose.  I've also tried to comment the code
to the extent I found useful.

There are no doubt bugs and/or better ways doing certain things (I am learning too).  Please submit issues/comments/feedback.

I'd greatly appreciate it.
